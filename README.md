# InstaMap

The script scrapes Instagram profile and generates a map using its data. Each location from the profile is represented on the map with a clickable marker with a pop-up window including different data from posts with this location (as date, thumbnail image, url, number of likes etc.)

Files:
1. MapGenerator.py - the entry point, takes no arguments
2. InstaScraper.py
3. requirements.txt

## Usage

Run MapGenerator.py file using command line 

```bash
MapGenerator.py

## Roadmap

- moving the data into server-based or client-based database
- adding different filtering and searching functionality
- creating another social media location scrapers and integrating them into one single map application
