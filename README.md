# InstaMap

The script scrapes Instagram profile and generates a map.html file using its data (with the help of Instaloader and Folium modules). 
Each location from the profile is represented on the map as a clickable marker with a pop-up window including 
different data from posts at this location (as date, thumbnail image, url, number of likes etc.);

====================================================================================================
